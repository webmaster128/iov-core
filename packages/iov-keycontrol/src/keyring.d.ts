KeyringEntry is a generic interface for managing a set of keys and signing
data with them. A KeyringEntry is instanciated using KeyringEntryFactory
and assigned to a Keyring.

A KeyringEntry is responsible for generating secure (random) private keys
and signing with them. KeyringEntry can be implemented in software or as
a bridge to a hardware wallet.

It is inspired by metamask's design:
https://github.com/MetaMask/KeyringController/blob/master/docs/keyring.md
